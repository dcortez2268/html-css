  HTML VOCAB

 html: hypertext-markup language, language that defines the structure for webpages
 css: cascading style sheets, styling language used to define styling for webpages
 javascript: language used to add functionality to webpages
 index.html: often represents the homepage of a website
 URL: uniform resource locator, the address of a given unique resource on the Web. there are relative urls and absolute urls
 
 Relative URLS: specifies the target resource relative to the current resource
 Absolute URL: specifies the location of a resource irrespective of the current resource.  It can start with a / to indicate the root of the website or a protocol to represent a resource on a different website.
 
 DOM: The document object model is an API for valid HTML documents.  It models the heirarchy of HTML objects in a tree data structure that can be traversed and manipulated to provide functionality for webpage
 
 attributes: provide additional information about our element, src and alt are attributes for img element 
 
 HTML document: consists of a DOCTYPE declaration that specifies the version of HTML being used followed by a tree (hierarchy) of elements that define the structure and content of the document.
 root element in an HTML document: the html element, which always includes a head and a body element. 
    head element: contains information about the page such as its title
    body element: includes the structure and content of the page.
 
 class: attribute that implements the grouping of elements to provide similar styling or behaviour
 id: attribute that implements a unique id for the the select element
 
 validating HTML/CSS pages: identifies potential errors in code, validator.w3.org for 
 HTML, jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator for css
 
 viewport: the viewable area of the webpage
 entities: special html characters denoted with prepended ampersand and end with a semicolon, ex of common html entitity is copyright symbol, nonbreaking space entity, html characters
 
 hyperlink and link: often used interchangeably but hyperlink denotes element with link and link is actual url referenced
 
 semantic HTML elements:  html that implements structure which provides meaning and description of data to search engines, screen readers, and other software

 block-level elements: always start on new line and take up entire horizontal available space.
 inline elements: don't start on new line and take up as much width as necassary.
 width and height properties: are only respected by block elements, span and inline-elements do not listen to these properties, you can change display: inline-block, to have an inline element that respects width and height properties, 
 by default, height of block level elements is zero and width 100% 

 media queries: we can provide different styles for different devices depending on features such as screen size, orientation, etc.  By using media queries and relative measurement units we can build responsive web sites that adjust smoothly to various screen sizes. 

 font stacks: contains multiple fonts as fallbacks in case of error with first font,
 network throttling: simulating a slow connection,
 caching: permanent storage browsers use to store assets for faster performance.  Itâ€™s essentially somewhere on the disk. The cache can always be cleared.

 typography: the use of type in a design.  It deals with fonts, size, color, layout, and other factors that affect the design of type on a page.

  margin collapsing: whenever top and bottom margins are combined into a single margin.  The size of the margin is equal to the largest of the two margins.

        IMAGES
*************************************************************************************-->

<!-- TYPES AND FORMATS -->
<!-- 2 formats of images: 
  raster: made up of pixels, come from cameras/scanners, JPG, PNG, GIF, etc, can be blurry if picture is too small and scaled up, takes long time to load if big size
  
  vector: defined by mathematical vectors like lines and curves, creates by software, SVG (scalable vector graphics) format, look sharp at any size, much smaller than raster images, be sure to use for logos, graphics, icons, and simple backgrounds!
-->
<!-- 2 types of images:
  content: use descriptive value for alt for people who use screen readers
  background:
  background-image property: or background property: defines which image to use
  background-repeat, background-position, background-size: useful properties to control background image
  background-attachment:fixed: background stays fixed relative to viewport
-->

<!-- CSS SPRITES -->
<!-- optimization technique that implements fewer http requests by combining images into one image so there is only one http request for all of the images, and splices the images in css to use individual image -->
<!-- disadvantages: file size can get too larges, sprites are not flexible -->
<!-- advantages: effective for icons and logos -->

<!-- DATA URLS -->
<!-- formerly known as data URIS -->
<!-- another optimization technique to reduce HTTP requests by embedding image directly into stylesheet or HTML document -->
<!-- cost: size of embedded code > size of the resource, increased       
  complexity, slow on mobile
  benefits: mosh personally doesn't think benefits outweigh costs-->
  
<!-- CLIPPING -->
  <!-- clipping is pretty cool tool that clips shape from image, free tools online -->
<!-- FILTERS -->
  <!-- grayscale, blur, contrast, brightness, saturate : popular properties -->
  
<!-- SUPPORTING HIGH DENSITY SCREENS (for fixed image size) -->
  <!-- physical resolution: based on actual number of pixels on device -->
  <!-- logical resolution: how the screens behave in displaying pixels  -->
  <!-- Device Pixel Ratio (DPR): ratio of physical/logical -->
  <!-- High Density Screen: screen with DPR > 1 -->
  
  <!-- problem arises when a high density screen renders original size of raster image because the image is blurry  -->
  <!-- to solve problem, we resize image to equal original image size x DPR -->
  <!-- for example if we define CSS of image to be 400x400 px, for  2 DPR screen the image provided should be 800x800, for DPR of 3 the size would be 1200x1200  -->
  <!-- implement the pics with srcset attribute of img element, and in css set img{width:400px} 
    
    srcset="
    images/meal.jpg   1x,
    images/meal@2x.jpg  2x
    images/meal@3x.jpg  3x"  -->
    
    <!-- CSS always based on logical resolution  -->
    <!-- don't overkill with support for every image, only implement if you have beautiful homepage or photo gallery with high resolution -->
    
<!-- RESOLUTION SWITCHING  -->
  <!-- problem: the browser implements same image size based on DPR, and then needs to resize the image because it doesn't have fixed width and the devices resolution (sizes) vary, very costly operation   -->
  <!-- solution: provide 3 different image sizes:small, medium, large and let browser pick best image for its resolution and DPR, sizes attribute displays the image with different relative widths based on screen size condition
    srcset="
    images/meal.jpg   400w,
    images/meal@2x.jpg  800w
    images/meal@3x.jpg  1200w"
    sizes="
    (max-width:500px) 100vw,
    (max-width:700px) 50vw,
    (max-width:*px) *vw,
    "
  -->
    
<!-- USING MODERN IMAGE FORMATS -->
    <!-- WebP format is a format of raster images -->
    <!-- how to convert: Photoshop (webpshop plug-in), sketch, online tools (cloudconvert.com/jpg-to-webp), scripts -->
    <!-- benefit is much smaller file size -->
    <!-- cost is that it's not quite as sharp as jpg, but very close, not supported by IE -->
<!-- ART DIRECTION -->
    <!-- when you want to show a zoomed in or cropped version of image for certain screen sizes -->
    <!-- use picture element -->
    <picture><source media="(max-width:500px;)"" srcset="images/meal-cropped.jpg">

  <!-- wrap i element in a span element to style, or just change i element to span -->

<!-- **********************************************************************************
        FORMS
*************************************************************************************-->
  <form action=""></form>
  <!-- action attribute: used for submitting form  -->
  <input type="text">
  <!-- input fields: also called form controls -->
  <label for=""></label>
  <!-- labels are inline elements, for attribute associates label with input field -->
  <button type="reset"></button> 
  <button type="submit"></button>
  <!--reset attribute resets values for all fields, and submit submits the form  -->

<!-- CSS FRAMEWORKS -->
  <!-- popular frameworks include Bootstrap, Foundation, Semantic UI, UI Kit, Materialize, Milligram -->
  <!-- I prefer Bootstrap, Mosh recommends milligram because it is a very lightweight framework and easy to use -->
  <!-- short learning curve to css frameworks but save you a lot of time in long run -->
  <!-- utility-first/atomic frameworks: have a ton of utility classes, ex Tailwind -->

<!-- TEXT FIELDS -->
  <!-- be familiar with attributes: value, placeholder, readonly, disabled, maxlength, autofocus -->
  <input type="text/number/password/date/email">
  <!-- popular types for input field-->
  <textarea name="." id="" cols="30" rows="10"></textarea>

<!-- DATA LISTS, (suggestion lists) -->
  <input type="text" list="countries" autocomplete="off">
  <datalist id="countries">
    <option data-value="">Australia</option>
    <option data-value="">Canada</option>
    <option data-value="">India</option>
    <option data-value="">United States</option>
  </datalist>
  </input>
  <!-- to implement custom styling you need to implement js, see mozilladev docs -->

<!-- DROP DOWN LISTS, -->
  <select multiple>
    <option value=""></option>
    <option value="1" selected>HTML</option>
    <option value="2">CSS</option>
    <option value="3">JAVASCRIPT</option>
  </select>
  <!-- multiple boolean attribute allows you to select multiple options, selected attribute tells browser to select this option when page is rendered, value attribute's value gets sent to server when form submitted -->
  <optgroup></optgroup>
  <!-- element used to group options together so you can have multiple groups per drop down -->

<!-- CHECKBOXES -->
  <input type="checkbox" name="" id="front-end" checked>
  <label for="front-end" class="label-inline">Front-end</label>
  <!-- checked attribute checks box when rendered -->

<!-- RADIO BUTTONS -->
  <input type="radio" name="membership" id="silver">
  <label for="silver" class="label-inline">Silver</label>
  <!-- name attribute is used for grouping of radio buttons -->

<!-- SLIDERS -->
  <input type="range" min="0" max="100" name="" id="" value="90">
  <!-- value sets initial value, use js to implement functionality with current value -->

<!-- FILE INPUTS -->
  <input type="file">
  <!-- important attributes: accept, multiple -->

<!-- GROUPING RELATED FIELDS -->
  <!-- use fieldset or section + legend or h2 to group input fields -->
  <fieldset><legend>Billing Address</legend><input type="text"><input type="text"><input type="text"><input type="text"><legend>Payment</legend><input type="text"><input type="text"><input type="text"><input type="text"></fieldset>

<!-- DATA VALIDATION  -->
  <!-- before submitting form, we should always validate the data being submitted -->
  <!-- required fields, valid emails, numbers and dates within valid range -->
  <!-- most done within js, but html5 input elements offers a little bit of validation -->
  <!-- important attributes: type, required, minlength, maxlength, min, max -->

<!-- SUBMITTTING THE FORM -->
  <form action=""><input type="text"><input type="text"><input type="text">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    <!-- have same output, but you should use button element -->
  </form>
  <!-- action attribute value is endpoint we send the data, absolute or relative url -->
  <!-- method attribute: value is GET or POST HTTP method we use to send data -->
  <!-- With the POST method, form data is included in the body of the request. With the GET method, form data is included in the URL as query string parameters. Thatâ€™s why the GET method is often used when we need to enable bookmarking pages. In contrast, the POST method is used when we need to update the data. -->

<!-- **********************************************************************************
        ANIMATIONS
*************************************************************************************-->

<!-- 2D TRANSFORMATIONS -->
<!-- rotate(), scale(), skew(), translate() -->
<!-- 3D TRANSFORMATIONS -->
<!-- transform: perspective() translateZ()/rotateY()
  transform-origin: xoffset yoffset
-->
<!-- you can define perspective on container or child elements -->
<!-- the transform property is used to apply one or more transformations to an element -->

<!-- TRANSITIONS -->
<!-- use transition property to animate one or more properties instead of going from point A to B instantly, we use it for simple animations  -->
<!-- transition: propertyWeAreUpdating duration ease-in/linear/ease-out/cubic-bezie() -->

<!-- ANIMATIONS -->
<!-- we use animate property for more complicated animations, for ex if we want different animations for more than one property -->
@keyframes customNameForAnimation {
  0% {
    styles for this frame
  }
  25% { styles for this frame}
  ...
  100% {...}
}
.container {
  animation-name: customNameForAnimation;
  animation-duration: 4s;
  animation-delay: 1s;
  animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  animation-timing-function: ...;
  animation-direction:...;
}
<!-- to create reusable animation put them in class, and then apply class to html elements -->
<!-- animate.style: provides CDN for animations -->

<!-- **********************************************************************************
        WRITING CLEAN, MAINTAINABLE, CSS
*************************************************************************************-->

<!-- BEST PRACTICES -->
<!-- follow naming convention -->
<!-- create logical sections in your stylesheet: for smaller size project you may have single stylesheet but for larger projects have multiple that get combined with SASS or LESS, label sections with comments -->
<!-- avoid over-specific selectors: avoid direct child selectors to avoid breaking changes, remove element types in hierarchies and instead resort to classes, use specific names for classes to avoid having to keep overwriting styles in different areas,  Limit nesting to two or maximum three selectors.  -->
<!-- avoid !important keyword -->
<!-- sort css properties in ascending or descending order so lines are easy to read -->
<!-- take advantage of style inheritance -->
<!-- extract repetitive patterns with object-oriented CSS -->
<!-- implement DRY principle, (don't repeat yourself: use css variables -->

<!-- CSS VARIABLES, or custom properties -->
<style>
  :root {
    /* where we can define custom properties or global variables */
    --color-primary: yellow;
    --border-size:2px;
    --border-radius: 10px;
  }
  
  .box { background: var(--color-primary);}
  </style>

<!-- OBJECT-ORIENTED CSS -->
  <!-- 2 principles: -->
  
  <!-- 1. seperate container from content: style components without container, and then you can reuse those components in different containers without having to redefine styles -->
  <!-- 2. seperate structure from skin: define style with common structure for components, and then for specific "skin" or look define seperate class with that specific skin, ex .btn and .btn-gold, always list more generic class first then more specific class next -->
  
  <!-- BEM, Block Element Modifier: popular naming convention -->
  <!-- think of our webpage as reusable components that contain elements and can be modified -->
  <!-- it follows the following naming convention for classes: -->
  <!-- blockName__elementName -->
  <!-- blockName blockName--modifier -->
  
<!-- **********************************************************************************
        PART 3 OF 3 OF CSS AND HTML COURSE
*************************************************************************************-->
<!-- coded along with mosh to build website, actual files will be in this repository and any other notes will be included below -->

<!-- 
  VOCAB: 
    media object, or media components: popular design for component where you have icon on left/right and then heading and text on other side,

    call out components: call on user to take action,
    color palette: composed of primary, secondary, and accent color, and other main colors, 
-->

<!--  
  iterative workflow: bottom up approach, components first (better than top down approach where we do page first and leads to a lot of issues and hard to troubleshoot)
    1. identify individual components to create and style based on design given to us
    2. use photoshop to determine typography
    3. create component inside index.html with styling, then export html to html file inside components folder
    4. commit changes
-->

<!-- 
  for good organization, implement BEM naming convention.  Use this for semantic html markup and list classes in inline styling from most general to most specific  
-->

<!-- 
  OPTOMIZING IMAGES: implements smaller image file size and if not done there will be a lot of resizing by browser which can be costly
    1. Figure out max width based on no larger than 500px on mobile and then figure out what other containers it will be in and proportion to container
    2. Implement the max width size in px for image using photoshop
    3. Provide 2, 3x files for High density screens using photoshop and cloudconvert.com for webp format
    4. use this ex for markup and to make image responspive on tablets and mobile (the img element gets used bc i dont think source element is compatible) then you need to set img css width property to 100%;

  <source
    srcset="images/resized/easy.webp 1x, images/resized/easy@2x.webp 2x"
    type="image/webp" />
  <source
    srcset="images/resized/easy.png 1x, images/resized/easy@2x.png 2x"
    type="image/png" />
  <img class="feature__image" src="images/resized/easy@2x.png" alt=""

<!-- 
  Putting it all together:
  1. Add Components to page one by one, and test responsivesness again(should be done first after you originally built component) on all screen sizes
  2.  If there are any layout issues, test the components in isolation, and delete elements off of component one by one to figure out issue.  Use chrome devtools (computed tab and styles tab ) to help figure out the styling issues.  you can also add borders to display the elements clearly.
  
  3. added animations with aos library, animate on scroll , link https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/

  4.added a few search engine optimization techniques: 
    changed title, added meta description tag, meta open graph tags (docs can be found on ogp.me)

  5. validated html markup and css

  6. building for production...
    build tools popular use cases are combining css and js files,
    minify js/css files,
    optomizing images,
    more but just depends on project
    
    some popular build tools are webpack, rollup, and parcel,
    recommends parcel over webpack bc there is little to no configuration,
    
    we installed parcel with npm package parcel-bundler,
